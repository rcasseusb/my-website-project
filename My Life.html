<p style="font-size: xx-large; font-style: oblique;"> My name is Rinella Casseus-Ballenger. I was Born in the United states from my mother who is from Haiti and my father who is American. Thus, I come from a family of two cultures, which is fun. I really enjoy being of a background that is not American as the history of Haiti is so inspiring and I am contantly reminded that I come from a generation of stong individuals who fight for what is right. The first five years of my life I was raised by ma Haitian grandparents. They both did not speak good english so my first laguage was Hatian creole. I could understand both languages but I had an issue when I first started school because I did not know which language to speak. Today I am fluent in both languages, english more than creole because m grandparents passed away before I went to high school. I enjoy hanging wit friends and family. I love to travel; so far I have been to the bahamas, the UK, France, and some of the states. Hopefuly, I can explore more areas in the future. I love to eat, since I was a little girl, I always enjoyed trying new foods.  </p>
