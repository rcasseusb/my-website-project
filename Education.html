<p style="font-size:larger; font-style: oblique;">I attended 4 schools throughout my lifetime. My first school was Robert Goddard Montessori school (RGMS) in Maryland. I went here for pre-k through 8th grade. while at Robert Goddard, I was enrolled in a program called Kumon which fuller enriched my academic skills. While at RGMS I was a part of the orchestra where I played the violin and performed at multiple concerts. Cheeleading was the main sport I was good at, I became the cheer captain during my 8th grade year.

<p style="font-size:larger; font-style: oblique;">    My high school education continues in Washington, D.C. at the Mckinley Technology High School. In this STEM focused school I participated in the biotechnology program because I knew I had an interes in the medical field and health. Although I did not know what I wanted to be I learned broad aspects of biology, how doctors and nurses help patients, and discovered environmental impacts on health. During my high school journey I ran track, served as class president and participated in an academic program called "Community CLub." The most impacting experiience I had while at my high school was when I was granted the opportunity to go to Harvard during the summer of my junior year. I was granted a full scholarship and had cost of travel and housing covered. I took the classes, biomedical ethics and public speaking. After my summer at Harvard, I was able to slightly narrow down which career path I want to go in under science.   </p>
 <p style="font-size:larger; font-style: oblique;">What further helped me to know what I was passionate about career-wise was my internship at the Department of Forensics. Here, I am mentored by the scientists in the public health microbiology laboratory. This is where I new for certain that I wanted to major in Public Health and to persue more than one degree. I have been in this internship since my junior year of high school; I learn lab technitian skills and get many opportunities to explore other branches in the building such as crime scene and OCME. </p>
 <p style="font-size:larger; font-style: oblique;"> Now I am a sophomore at the George Washington University. I am a Public Health major with a minor in Business. I am debating if I want to double minor in political science or criminal justice. I do intend on getting a master in Public health. I am very passionate in combating racial disparities and global health. I hope to travel abroad while in college. I am still in the proces of finding what career title I will have, but I know i will have a huge impact on those who need my help. </p>
